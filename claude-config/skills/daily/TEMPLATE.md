Template notes (remove in actual posts):
- Omit any section that would be empty
- "At a Glance" counts: Issues = created + closed, PRs = opened + merged
- Focus column should answer "what and why" not just "what files"
- Comments: truncate to first meaningful line
- External pushes = contributions to repos you don't have cloned
