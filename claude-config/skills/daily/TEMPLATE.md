Template notes (remove in actual posts):
- TL;DR is for sharing with non-technical teammates - outcomes not activities
- Highlights answer "what moved forward" not "what did I touch"
- Commits table: repo links, focus on "what and why"
- Open Threads: only actionable items, skip merged/closed unless notable
- Also Today: research, exploration, conversations - the non-git work
- Stats at bottom - reference data, not the headline
- Omit any section that would be empty
