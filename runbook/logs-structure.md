# Logs Directory Structure

Central location for session logs, daily summaries, meeting notes, and project log symlinks.

## Overview

The `~/logs/` directory follows a consistent structure:

```
~/logs/
├── daily/                    # Daily summaries
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-daily-summary.md
│   └── raw/                  # Automated script outputs
│       └── YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-daily-github-summary.md
├── meetings/                 # Meeting agendas and notes
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-type.md
├── projects/                 # Symlinks to project-specific logs
│   └── project-name -> ~/dev/org/repo/logs/...
└── archive/                  # Historical data, processed JSON
```

## Directory Reference

| Directory | Purpose | Naming Convention |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `daily/` | Curated daily summaries | `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-summary.md` |
| `daily/raw/` | Raw script outputs (accumulate) | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-daily-github-summary.md` |
| `meetings/` | Meeting agendas, notes, action items | `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-type.md` |
| `projects/` | Symlinks to repo log directories | `project-name` (descriptive) |
| `archive/` | Old data, JSON dumps, processed files | Varies |

## Daily Summaries

Two-tier system for daily logs:

1. **Raw outputs** (`daily/raw/`) - Timestamped, never edited
   - Generated by `/daily` skill
   - Multiple runs per day accumulate
   - Source data for curated summaries

2. **Curated summaries** (`daily/`) - One per day, manually refined
   - Human-readable format with TL;DR
   - Published to blog repo
   - See `runbook/daily-summary.md` for workflow

### Daily Summary Format

```yaml
---
title: "Daily Summary - YYYY-MM-DD"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [daily-summary]
tags: [relevant, topics]
---
```

Sections: TL;DR, Highlights, Commits (table), Added Repos, Open Threads, Also Today, Stats

## Meetings

Meeting files aggregate information for team syncs:

- Pull from multiple days of daily summaries
- Include team member highlights
- Track discussion topics and action items
- Format: markdown with tables

Example: `2026-01-13-team-meeting-agenda.md`

## Project Logs

Symlinks in `projects/` point to log directories within repositories:

```bash
# Add a new project log symlink
ln -s ~/dev/org/repo/logs/test-runs ~/logs/projects/project-test-runs
```

Common use cases:
- Test run outputs from CI/cron jobs
- Build logs
- Deployment records

Naming: Use descriptive names that identify the project and log type (e.g., `aibtc-x402-test-runs`)

## Integration with Skills

| Skill | Reads | Writes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/daily` | - | `daily/raw/` |
| `/daily-brief` | `daily/`, `meetings/`, `projects/` | - |

## Adding New Log Types

1. Create the directory under `~/logs/` following the `topic/` pattern
2. Document the naming convention in this file
3. Update relevant skills if they should read/write the new location
